# Robot-Maze-Game
A game where you have to escape a maze but you are followed by a bot


WELCOME! to Savi's Epic prison maze escape😊. In this game you are a prisoner 🥷 (the #) and you are being chased down by the
gaurd 👮( the %). Your goal is to get to the entrance at the top of the maze without getting caught by the gaurd. You move by
entering a number which corresponds to a certain movement, REMEBER entering a value thats not in the options can result in
you loosing your turn, after all you are escaping a gaurd and any hestitaion or miscalculation on your part can get you
caught. There will be walls : | or - which will be blocking your way remeber to avoid them at all costs since running into
one can cause you an entire turn in which the gaurd will be able to come closer to you. Also a point you should remeber is
unlike you the gaurd can move through walls. Anyways thats all from me I hope you enjoy my game and have fun. :) <- Savi ❤️👌
